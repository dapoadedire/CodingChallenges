Design a parking lot management system. The parking lot has 15 slots, 10 slots can only accommodate small vehicles and the rest of the 5 can accommodate both small and bigger vehicles. The parking fee for the first 10 slots is 60 USD (Please use a local currency equivalent if you prefer to do so) and the parking fee for the last 5 slots is 100 USD. The maximum parking time is 30 minutes, after which an extra 15 USD is charged for every extra hour spent in the parking using html css and JavaScript
